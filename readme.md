# Akvelon python internship3 task
###### Made by Ayaz Muhametov (@justayaz)
Contains "finances" app with REST tasks
and "utils.py" with second task

**There were difficulties during the implementation of 'amount by date', so I was only able to implement the total amount for each user. I pointed it out in the comments.**

I've tried to describe each class and serializer to make it clear for you

Since the project is small, I think there is no need to explain how to use this API
